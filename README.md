# Cpp-Shapes-hierarchy
The main aim of this project is to help you to understand two basic OOP principes:

* Polymorphysm
> the provision of a **single interface** to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types
* Abstraction
> * the process of removing physical, spatial, or **temporal** details or attributes in the study of objects or systems in order to more closely attend to other details of interest; it is also very similar in nature to the process of generalization;
> * the abstract concept-objects which are created by keeping **common features or attributes** to various concrete objects or systems of study — the result of the process of abstraction.

## Project structure:

The project consists from the 2 main folder *Abstract* & *Basis* that contains abstract and basic part of project;
